# CodeToLearn

**Learn practical skills by building real-world projects.**

CodeToLearn provides curated project templates designed specifically for junior developers and anyone looking to strengthen their portfolio by *doing*. Move beyond tutorials and build something tangible!

## Mission

Our goal is to empower aspiring developers to build confidence and a strong portfolio by providing structured, real-world project templates with clear goals and requirements.

## What is CodeToLearn?

Instead of just giving you an idea, we provide:

*   **Project Templates:** Starter codebases (ranging from nearly empty to partially complete) hosted in dedicated GitHub repositories.
*   **Clear Requirements:** Each template comes with a defined set of features to build or bugs to fix.
*   **Defined Goals/Metrics:** Understand what "done" looks like â€“ whether it's functionality, testing metrics, or performance goals.
*   **Focus on Portfolio:** Projects are designed to be practical examples of skills you can showcase to potential employers.

## How It Works

1.  **Discover:** Browse project templates on our platform (coming soon!) or directly via GitHub. Filter by technology, difficulty, and skills.
2.  **Clone:** Choose a project and clone its dedicated template repository.
3.  **Build:** Follow the requirements outlined in the template's README to build your own version.
4.  **Learn:** Gain hands-on experience with specific technologies and concepts.
5.  **Showcase:** Add your completed project to your GitHub profile and personal portfolio!

## Finding Projects

Project templates will be listed on our upcoming website. In the meantime, browse repositories in the [CodeToLearn GitHub Organization](https://github.com/codetolearn-org) (Replace with your actual org link once created, or link to a list/directory later).

Each template repository will contain:
*   Detailed `README.md` with requirements, goals, setup instructions, and learning outcomes.
*   Starter code.
*   Appropriate license and `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

We believe in learning together! We welcome contributions for:

*   **New Project Templates:** Have an idea for a great portfolio project?
*   **Improving Existing Templates:** Found a bug or have a suggestion?
*   **Developing the Web Platform:** Want to help build the main CodeToLearn website?

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (We'll create this next!) for guidelines.

## Future Plans

*   Launch the web application for easy project discovery and filtering.
*   Expand the library of project templates across various tech stacks and difficulty levels.
*   Potentially add features like user progress tracking and showcase galleries.
